		 /* 1. Write a function named countRepresentations that returns the number of
		 * ways that an amount of money in American dollars can be represented in
		 * American bills. The signature of the function is: int
		 * countRepresentations(int numDollars) For example countRepresentations(12)
		 * should return 4 because 12 dollars can be represented in the following four
		 * ways. 1. 12 one dollar bills 2. 1 five dollar bill plus 7 one dollar bills 3.
		 * 2 five dollar bills plus 2 one dollar bills 4. 1 ten dollar bill plus 2 one
		 * dollar bills For this question assume that American bills occur only in
		 * denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 20 dollar bills. Hint: Use a nested loop that
		 * looks like this. Please fill in the blanks intelligently, i.e. minimize the
		 * number of times that the if statement is executed. */
