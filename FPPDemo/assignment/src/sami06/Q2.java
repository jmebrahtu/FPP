		 * was discovered around 1400 by the Indian mathematician Madhavan Namboodiri
		 * and was rediscovered by Gottfried Liebniz about 300 years. Write a function
		 * named approximatePI that returns the value of this sequence after a given
		 * number of iterations. If the number of iterations is less than or equal to 0,
		 * the function should return -1.*/
